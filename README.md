Webapp to manage current and future projects, (hopefully) minimizing the number of overall projects. Having less concurrently active projects leads to faster completion, as ones energy is naturally more focused.

## About

Based on the concept of minimizing the number of active projects to focus on getting those done, I built an non-interactive html site, listing my current projects, to stay mindful of how many active projects I had.
As editing the source every time I updated my projects wasn't very practical, I built this app from scratch to solve that problem and learn node/express/mongo in the process.
