## FAQ

**Q: What is this?**<br>
**A:** Projects-overview is a webapp to manage all of your current and future projects, not going into the projects themselves, but giving a high level overview over your current engagements.

**Q: Why would I use this?**<br>
**A:** Projects-overview is designed to help you minimize the number of active projects, which in turn helps you to actually finish those projects, as your focus is less spread out.

**Q: Why did you build this?**<br>
**A:** I read in one of [Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/)s books that minimize my number of active projects will increase my focus in working on them. I then built this app to keep an overview over my active projects, having the overview discouraged my impulse to just start something and held me accountable to actually finishing projects. More on the history in the about section.

## Installation

If you want to run the webapp yourself follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/jneidel/projects-overview/blob/latest/README.md) of the latest release.

## About

Based on the concept of minimizing the number of active projects to focus on getting those done, I built an non-interactive html site, listing my current projects, to stay mindful of how many active projects I had.
As editing the source every time I updated my projects wasn't very practical, I built this app from scratch to solve that problem and learn node/express/mongo in the process.
